The changelog.md documents all changes made to our ML Final Project on a weekly basis:

April 2nd 2018
  -Pivot from original project idea, have now moved to combatting accessibility problems for players playing 2D sidescrollers
    -The idea aims to combat the issue of some players having physical difficulty playing these sorts of games
    
  -Our aim is to provide a user experince that is unique to every player and every disability and thus Machine Learning would be great to     combat this problem
  
  -Wekinator takes in various inputs and sends out OSC signal (which mimic keystrokes) 
  
  -For our in class demo we prepared playing the popular side scroller Mario, and used X-Y cordinates of our face to move the character 
   as well as make Mario Jump
