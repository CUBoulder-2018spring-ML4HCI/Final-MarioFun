The changelog.md documents all changes made to our ML Final Project on a weekly basis:

April 2nd 2018

  -Pivot from original project idea, have now moved to combatting accessibility problems for players playing 2D sidescrollers
    -The idea aims to combat the issue of some players having physical difficulty playing these sorts of games
    
  -Our aim is to provide a user experince that is unique to every player and every disability and thus Machine Learning would be great to     combat this problem
  
  -Wekinator takes in various inputs and sends out OSC signal (which mimic keystrokes) 
  
  -For our in class demo we prepared playing the popular side scroller Mario, and used X-Y cordinates of our face to move the character 
   as well as make Mario Jump
   
April 4th 2018
  
  -This week our empahsis grew on incorporating mulitiple devices to play these side scrollers
  
  -We worked directly with the MicroBit Controller as well as the Tobii Eye-Tracker to make devices you can play side scrollers with
  
  -We also discussed ways to send keystrokes to a emulator, allowing for the playability of all 2-D Sidescrollers, not just online based 2D   games
  
  -We talked about how we need to create a program to send and train Wekinator, deciding what the UI may look like, as well as what the       user experince would look like for that program
